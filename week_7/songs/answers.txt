It looks like the users 'aura' is a little more energetic than calm, and pretty much danceable.
But it looks like the user enjoys both the songs with positive and negative emotions in it, because of valence values.

The 'aura' formula might be not very representative. It will be probably more useful to determine specific clusters
or groups of compositions that have something in common and leverage their relationship in the user's personal taste.
